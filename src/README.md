Umbra
===
by Kelly Dwan (@ryelle, redradar.net) and Mel Choyce (@melchoyce, choycedesign.com)

Umbra is a colorful new WordPress theme. Powered by Jetpack's Tonesque library, Umbra derives its palette from your very own images, or from a color you pick.

###Dynamic Colors

If you have [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me) installed and active, the theme will pull a color from the first image it finds in your post, and use that to generate a color scheme for the page. You can also set the default scheme just by choosing a single color.

###Social Menus

We've made it easy to add links to your social accounts. Just follow the handy instructions located on our documentation page at http://themes.redradar.net/umbra/documentation/.

###Fully responsive

Umbra is fully responsive, working well on everything from your phone to your large monitor.

###Jetpack enabled

Supercharge Umbra with Jetpack galleries, carousels, infinite scroll, and Photon.
